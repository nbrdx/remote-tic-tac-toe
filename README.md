<h1 align="center">Welcome to Remote Tic-Tac-Toe üëã</h1>

A remote Tic Tac Toe developed using React for the front and Node.js along with Socket.io for the back.
The goal was to build a simple remote multiplayer game.

### ‚ú® [Demo](https://remote-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app)

As the game is made for 2 players, find someone to play with and share the link, or enter the "matchmaking" on your own in 2 different browser tabs to play against yourself.

## Slides

I gave a talk in french on how to build this remote tic-tac-toe. You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G3WOzKjgtmwP7JJlGyYW0n9B0qur3si-lKzTXBv3TSo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Install

First, install main dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Then front and back

```sh
npm run install:children
```

## Usage

Start the node.js server and react front

```sh
npm run start
```

## Deployment

The Node.js server is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

The React front is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
